<b>Facade Pattern:</b>
<br/>
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.<br/>
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.<br/>

<br/>
User want's to watch movie in DVD. In order to watch movie user has to do some<br/> 
set of operation sequentially rather than just one click to "watchMovie" and the same<br/>
is true for "endMovie". So not user friendly.<br./>
What user wants is that user will click on one button and set the movie user wants to watch<b/>
and while setting off the system user wants to click one button "endMovie"<br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<b>Question &amp; Condition:</b>
	<ol>
		<li> In future we can add any subsystem in order to watch movie. We should be able to add<br/>
			 any subsystem, but client should not bother about this new subsystem, user still want:<br/>
			 "I will click "watchMovie" and "endMovie"
		</li>
		<li> We need to decouples a client from a complex subsystem.</li>
	</ol> 
<hr/>
<b>Solutions &amp; Design principles:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>We will use Facade pattern</li>
		<li> We can implement more than one facade for a subsystem</li>
	</ol>
<hr/>	
<b>So Object Oriented Principles:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li> Encapsulate what varies </li>
	  <li> Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A)</li>
	  <li> Program to interfaces, not to implementations</li>
	  <li> Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact</li>
	  <li> Class should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
	  <li> Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concretion</li>
	  <li> Only talk to your fiends (Facade Pattern..will come soon)</li>
	</ul>
