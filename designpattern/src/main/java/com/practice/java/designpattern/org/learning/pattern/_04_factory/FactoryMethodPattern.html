<b>Factory Method Pattern:</b>
<br/>
It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which 
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

 Building a PizzaFactory. We can have following pizza stores.<br/> 
 <ul>
 	<li>NewYork Pizza Store</li>
 	<li>Chicago Pizza Store</li>
 </ul>
So here above mentioned two are <b>Creator</b>.<br/>
Now each pizza store will provide the different types of pizza:<br/>
	<ul>
	 	<li>Cheese pizza</li>
	 	<li>Veggie pizaa</li>
	 </ul>
	 and more..<br/>
So the different types of pizza(s) are our <b>Product</b><br/>
Please Note: The cheese pizza of NewYork will not be same as Chicago.<br/>

<b>Solutions &amp; Design principles:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>We will use Factory Method pattern:<br/>
			Encapsulate the object creation. 
			Let the subclasses decide which object to instantiate.
		</li>
	</ol>
<hr/>	
<b>So Object Oriented Principles:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li> Encapsulate what varies </li>
	  <li> Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A)</li>
	  <li> Program to interfaces, not to implementations</li>
	  <li> Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact</li>
	  <li> Class should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
	</ul>
