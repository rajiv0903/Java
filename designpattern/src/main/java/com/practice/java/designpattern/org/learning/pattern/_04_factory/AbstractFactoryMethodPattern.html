<b>Abstract Factory Method Pattern:</b>
<br/>
It provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent<br/>
objects without specifying their concrete classes.
<hr/>

<b>So Object Oriented Principles:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li> Encapsulate what varies </li>
	  <li> Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A)</li>
	  <li> Program to interfaces, not to implementations</li>
	  <li> Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact</li>
	  <li> Class should be open for extension but closed for modification</li>
	  <li>Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.</li>
	</ul>
